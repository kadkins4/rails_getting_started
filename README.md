# Getting Started with Rails

For this assignment you will be walking through Rails' official "Getting Started With Rails" guide.

## Instructions

Create a repo called `getting-started-with-rails` on Github. Then clone it down and change into the resulting directory.

```bash
$ git clone your-repo-url-goes-here
$ cd getting-started-with-rails
```

Then follow the steps in chapters 1-5 of [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

## The Code-Along

The coding portion of this assignment begins in section 3.2.

After you follow the first two steps of the walkthrough (i.e., `rails new blog` and `cd blog`), run `$ git init` in the Terminal.

From that point on, commit your progress at the end of each section.

## Submission

When you have completed the homework, push your work to the repo you created at the beginning of this assignment. Then [submit an issue](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/rails_getting_started/issues/new) on this repo that contains a link to your own repo.
